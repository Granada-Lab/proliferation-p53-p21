# DNA damage, proliferation, and p53-p21 interplay
Data analysis of two published datasets (PMID: 32049575 and PMID: 30057196) to see how DNA damage levels are quantitatively translated into p53 and p21 signal parameters in a gradual manner and which is the relationship to proliferation heterogeneity.
